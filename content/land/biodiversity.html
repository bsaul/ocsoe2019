<p>Each May and June, after an exhausting migration for many bird species, a group of volunteers travel the roads of Orange County to listen for who has chosen to make a nest in our neighborhood. The <a href="http://rhwiley.bio.unc.edu/mbbs/">mini bird breeding survey</a>, a regional version of the <a href="https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/">long-running national survey</a>, has tracked local bird populations since 1999. Such systematically collected data makes it possible to examine trends in bird biodiversity on a local scale.</p>

<p>Certain iconic specialist species such as the Wood Thrush have declined by as much as XX% in the past 20 years. Anyone who has enjoyed a summer hike in <a href="https://gis.orangecountync.gov:8443/TrailsAndParks/default.html">one of our local parks</a> will certainly recognize the <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Wood_Thrush/sounds">Wood Thrushâ€™s flutely song</a>. While loss and fragmentation of the eastern deciduous forest has certainly contributed to Wood Thrush decline, the <a href="https://insider.si.edu/2016/01/loss-breeding-grounds-north-america-likely-cause-wood-thrush-decline/">winter range and travel routes of migratory birds are equally important</a>, demonstrating how changes to a local ecosystem can have global consequences.</p>
<p>TODO: One more paragraph with a story of another bird perhaps connected to climate change. Nuthatches perhaps or another species of local concern?</p>
