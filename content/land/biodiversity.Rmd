Each May and June, after an exhausting migration for many bird species, a group of volunteers travel the roads of Orange County to listen for who has chosen to make a nest in our neighborhood. The [mini bird breeding survey](http://rhwiley.bio.unc.edu/mbbs/), a regional version of the [long-running national survey](https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/), has tracked local bird populations since 1999. Such systematically collected data makes it possible to examine trends in bird biodiversity on a local scale.


```{r, class = "bio_image", echo = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = dt,
  aes(x = year, y = count)
) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() + 
  scale_y_continuous(
    "Average MBBS Count",
    limits = c(0, 9)
  ) + 
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.background = element_blank()
  ) + 
  ggtitle(
    "Wood Thrush counts during the MBBS"
  )

```

Certain iconic specialist species such as the Wood Thrush have declined by as much as XX% in the past 20 years. Anyone who has enjoyed a summer hike in [one of our local parks](https://gis.orangecountync.gov:8443/TrailsAndParks/default.html) will certainly recognize the [Wood Thrushâ€™s flutely song](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Wood_Thrush/sounds). While loss and fragmentation of the eastern deciduous forest has certainly contributed to Wood Thrush decline, the [winter range and travel routes of migratory birds are equally important](https://insider.si.edu/2016/01/loss-breeding-grounds-north-america-likely-cause-wood-thrush-decline/), demonstrating how changes to a local ecosystem can have global consequences.

TODO: One more paragraph with a story of another bird perhaps connected to climate change. Nuthatches perhaps or another species of local concern?
