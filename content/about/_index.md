   "As I penetrated its old roads, I felt its loneliness that I was to know by day through silences broken only by a hawk’s screaming or the shouting of crows and by night through the moaning of owls and the barking of half-wild dogs and foxes. This was a wilderness of the land to match the wilderness of the heart." —John Terres From Siler's Bog to Mason Farm.
