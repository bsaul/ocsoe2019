      <description>With time, more EVs will become available for more purposes. There are several benefits for Orange County to convert to EVs.
Reduce Emissions EVs would help the county meet the emissions goals for their Covenant of Mayors agreement. Even plug in hybrid vehicles greatly reduce CO2 emissions.
 Save Money The considerable up front costs of electric vehicles could be reduced with leasing options. The operating costs of EVs are lower than combustion engine vehicles because there are far fewer maintenance costs, no oil changes, no refrigerants, no transmission fluid.</description>
